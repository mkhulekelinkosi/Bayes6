The Laplace transform is a powerful tool in mathematics, particularly useful for solving differential equations and analyzing systems. To find the distribution of a random variable using the Laplace transform, you typically follow these steps:

1. Define the Random Variable

Let ( X ) be a continuous random variable with probability density function (PDF) ( f_X(x) ).

2. Laplace Transform of the PDF

The Laplace transform of the PDF ( f_X(x) ) is given by: $$ \mathcal{L}{f_X(x)}(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-sx} f_X(x) , dx $$

3. Find the Laplace Transform

Compute the Laplace transform of the PDF. For example, if ( f_X(x) ) is an exponential distribution with parameter ( \lambda ), then: $$ f_X(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x} \quad \text{for} \quad x \geq 0 $$ The Laplace transform is: $$ \mathcal{L}{f_X(x)}(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-sx} \lambda e^{-\lambda x} , dx = \frac{\lambda}{s + \lambda} $$

4. Inverse Laplace Transform

To find the original distribution from its Laplace transform, you need to perform the inverse Laplace transform. The inverse Laplace transform is given by: $$ f_X(x) = \mathcal{L}^{-1}{F(s)}(x) $$ where ( F(s) ) is the Laplace transform of ( f_X(x) ).

Example

Let's consider an example where ( X ) follows an exponential distribution with parameter ( \lambda ).

PDF: ( f_X(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x} )
Laplace Transform: $$ \mathcal{L}{f_X(x)}(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-sx} \lambda e^{-\lambda x} , dx = \frac{\lambda}{s + \lambda} $$
Inverse Laplace Transform: $$ f_X(x) = \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left{\frac{\lambda}{s + \lambda}\right}(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x} $$

Thus, we have recovered the original exponential distribution.

Conclusion

Using the Laplace transform to find the distribution involves transforming the PDF, computing the Laplace transform, and then applying the inverse Laplace transform to retrieve the original distribution. This method is particularly useful for solving complex differential equations and analyzing the behavior of systems in engineering and physics.
